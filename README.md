# ToDoList
Using Python, I created a To-DO list designed for college students in order to keep track of tasks/assignments. Some features present is the ability to label each task under a specific class that a student may have, and the ability to assign each task to a due date. Additionally, the list sorts each task, and keeps the tasks due earliest at the top of the list.

The current code is utilized in the terminal and responds to user inputs. The way it works is the user is asked questions, and based on their response, the code will allow users to edit their to-do list.
